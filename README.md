# Bridge_suspension
 
This program calculates the movements of a mass ("bridge") on two same strings, for some inputted values, using fsolve and solve_ivp, which is great for solving systems of ODEs, and integrating.
There is also a plot which shows these movements, and later conservation of energy is checked, to see if no physics laws were broken
